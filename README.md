# React - Navigation

I want to ilustrate how to work with [universal-routing][1] and [react-toolbox][2] components to easily create a started site, with a login page and a dashboard view.

For the navbar I'm using [AppBar][3], for the input fields [Input][4], in the dashboard routing section I'm passing a context in which I store the login information [Context][5].

## Getting Started

To get started, first install all the necessary dependencies.
```
> npm install
```

Start the development server (changes will now update live in browser)
```
> npm run start
```
